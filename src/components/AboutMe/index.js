        I am Diego Azevedo, glad to see you here!!! I am a full stack developer
        who loves front end and all the magic that CSS can do. I have been
        playing with React, JavaScript and sometimes with React Native as well.
      </Styled.Text>
      <Styled.Text>
        I love the front end side but I also able to get my hands dirty with PHP
        and all that combo that comes with the language of the elephant. This is
        the space to post some of the jobs I do in my free time.
      </Styled.Text>
    </Styled.Container>
